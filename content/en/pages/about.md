# Hi, I'm Erinç Uysal.
I'm an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student with a long-standing passion for technology. 
I have a particular interest in open-source software and Linux systems. I work on projects related to embedded systems, PCB design, amateur radio, and radio astronomy.

Current projects I'm working on:

- [WisteriaWM](https://github.com/WisteriaWM/Wisteria): Developing my own Wayland compositor.
- RF Projects: Conducting research related to my thesis on radio frequency.

On this blog, I share my projects, what I learn, and topics that interest me. I’m always learning and working on new projects in technology. 
If you're also passionate about technology, feel free to check out my projects and visit my YouTube channel.
