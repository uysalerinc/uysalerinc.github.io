        <h2> My Interests</h2>

        <p>
           I have been a vegetarian since December 2021. I prefer cats over
          dogs. My favorite author is Ursula K. Le Guin. My favorite anime is
          'Serial Experiments Lain,' and my favorite manga is 'Berserk.' I love
          folk metal. I use Arch Linux (btw). (N)Vim is the best text editor.
